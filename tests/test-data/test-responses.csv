Discussion in a safe place which often created a space where talking with the motivation to make steps forward became a place where talking was praying out loud among friends.  The session on Power particularly helped me to move on from a situation where power had been used very badly to encourage me to appreciate my current situation where power is used wisely and justly.  The evaluation session helped me to see through the eyes of others the progress I have made over the two units covered so far - I have, as a direct result of the comments made by a fellow participant who has been in the same group for both units, stepped over a threshold to a place of restoration.",All of it,Strongly disagree,No,Yes,"Yes, a great deal","It has enhanced a unit within IME2 curacy training where we are asked to develop and show the ability to build and lead teams which carry out the work which clergy cannot do themselves in addition to clerical duties and remain healthy and sane. So, projects which need to happen can be led, but we are still able to devote our time to prayer, pastoral care, leading services, preaching, running Lent courses and so forth, without running ourselves ragged.",Strongly agree,Materials are well designed and comprehensive but still work well with one being selective from the range available each week.,Strongly agree,"Less 'submissions' than contributions to the weekly meetings but yes, helpful."

I found the fact that asking others questions instead of suggestions kept everything focused for the group and by doing so enables the leader to evaluate their own work and then take away and reflect on it. It was good you were given information to work with at each session whether you used it or brought your own situation was both beneficial. Having others from different areas of ministry both clergy and lay,  was great, it brought with it a humility that was tangible in the group and I felt supported by all and able to speak freely without feeling intimidated even though we were on Zoom.   Overall a positive experience, and a good learning platform. ",All of it,Agree,No,Yes,"Yes, somewhat",By allowing myself  to listen more to what is going on practically.
